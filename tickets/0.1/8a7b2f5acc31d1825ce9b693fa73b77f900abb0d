When issuing a ticket modification command (i.e. fixing/reopening/taking) from
inside a subdirectory of the working tree's root, the ticket is removed from
the git-it DB altogether!

For example:

  $ it list
  0123456 Some ticket

  $ cd subdir
  $ it fix 0123456
  ticket '0123456' fixed

  $ it list -a
  (no more ticket named 0123456)
