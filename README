Git-it is a Git issue tracker, implemented in Python. Git-it can register
tickets alongside Git-managed source code for a project, to keep a managed list
of issues, bugs, features or tasks in sync with co-developers and to manage
project and milestone progress.

Typical commands to get started with git-it is:
- Initialize a new ticket database:
	it init

- Push the ticket database branch to an upstream repo, if applicable:
	git push origin git-it

- Other developers can now fetch the branch from an upstream repo, if
  applicable:
	git fetch origin git-it
	git co -b git-it origin/git-it

Then, typical workflow with git-it is:
- Fetch and push changes to sync with upstream:
	it sync 	(not yet implemented!)

- List all tickets:
	it list

- Add a new ticket:
	it new

- Close/reopen existing tickets:
	it fix <ticket-id>
	it reject <ticket-id>
	it close <ticket-id>
	it reopen <ticket-id>
